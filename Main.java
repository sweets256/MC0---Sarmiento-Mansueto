/**
 * This was made in requirement of our CCPROG3 major course output, MCO1.
 * This code is meant to run a game called "Elden Rouge", a 2-D text-based game based on "Elden Ring".
 * The code enables the player to traverse the game options by creating a character of their choice and 
 * selecting options in the game lobby to either fast travel or level up. The only accessible area for 
 * this phase of the project via fast travel is Area 1: Stormveil Castle, where the player will be able 
 * to encounter mobs and runes whilst exploring and interacting with the map. However, they will not be 
 * able to attack these mobs and will only be shown the mobs' name and health stat.
